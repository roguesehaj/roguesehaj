Iâ€™m [**Sehaj**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arorasehajbir/), a frontend developer and computer science student based in India.

I love building interfaces that are fast, intuitive, and actually enjoyable to use. I care about good design, clean code, and tools that make life simpler.

Outside of tech, I spend a lot of time making music; producing, writing, or just messing around with sounds that make me feel something. I also lead a content team and enjoy sharing thoughts on tech, learning, and life online.

#### Fun Facts:

* I prefer silence over caffeine.
* My playlists are organized better than my file system.
